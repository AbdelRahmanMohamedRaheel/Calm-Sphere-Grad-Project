                            Cultural relativism suggests that ethics, morals, values, norms, beliefs, and behaviors must be understood within the context of the culture from which they arise. It emphasizes that no universal standard exists to judge cultural norms, and all cultures are equally valid.

                        <p>
                            The concept of cultural relativism was introduced by anthropologist Franz Boas in 1887. While he did not coin the term, it became widely used by his students to describe his anthropological perspective and theories.
