For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone."

        "response": "That sense of overwhelm is so real. What’s one thing—just one—that feels manageable or within reach right now?"
    },
    {
        "input": "Nothing ever changes, no matter how hard I try.",
        "response": "That sounds discouraging. Have you had small wins before—even if they didn’t solve everything—that reminded you of your strength?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I wake up already feeling anxious.",
        "response": "Morning anxiety can hit hard. Do you start your day with anything that helps ground you, like quiet time, music, or even a routine?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I don’t think I’m strong enough to handle this anymore.",
        "response": "That’s a painful place to be. You’ve already handled so much just by surviving this far. Would it help to talk through one small next step together?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I’m scared I’ll fail my graduation project.",
        "response": "That fear is valid—it's a big moment. What specifically worries you most: the deadline, the presentation, or not doing it 'perfectly'?"
    },
    {
        "input": "My grad project makes me so anxious I avoid working on it.",
        "response": "Avoidance is often how anxiety shows up. When you think about starting, what thoughts or feelings come up first?"
    },
    {
        "input": "Everyone else seems more confident about their project than me.",
        "response": "Comparison can make pressure feel heavier. Do you know if others have support or resources you're missing—or could you ask for some help too?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I feel like my project isn’t good enough.",
        "response": "It’s easy to doubt yourself when the stakes feel high. What part of your project are you most proud of, even if it’s small?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I can’t sleep because I’m so stressed about finishing everything.",
        "response": "Lack of sleep makes stress even harder. Have you tried breaking your project into small, time-blocked tasks to make it feel more doable?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I’m afraid to present in front of the panel.",
        "response": "Presentation anxiety is totally normal. Do you want to go over some grounding tips or ways to practice that might ease your nerves?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I keep thinking my project will fall apart at the last minute.",
        "response": "That worst-case thinking can feel overwhelming. Can we talk through a backup plan or one way to increase your confidence in what you’ve done?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I work on my project all day but feel like I’ve done nothing.",
        "response": "That’s a tough spot. Have you been tracking your progress or giving yourself breaks to reset? Sometimes we do more than we realize."
    },
    {
        "input": "What if I disappoint my family by failing?",
        "response": "That’s a heavy pressure. Do they know how hard you’re working? Even if you’re afraid to talk to them, it might help to share what you’re going through."
    },
    {
        "input": "I just want to give up on my graduation project.",
        "response": "You’ve made it this far, which already shows strength. Want to talk about what part feels impossible right now—and if we can make it feel smaller?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I have no motivation to even open my project file.",
        "response": "That’s a real sign of burnout. Would it help to commit to just 10 minutes of light work—something small that feels less overwhelming?"
    },
    {
        "input": "The deadline is getting closer and I’m panicking.",
        "response": "That panic is your brain reacting to pressure. Can we create a mini action plan together, even just for today, to help you feel more in control?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I keep staring at my screen and doing nothing.",
        "response": "That freeze response is common with stress. Could you try changing locations, or using a timer to focus for just 15 minutes?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I’m too nervous to practice my project presentation.",
        "response": "Practicing while nervous is still progress. Have you tried rehearsing out loud to yourself, or recording it on your phone to review gently?"
    },
    {
        "input": "What if I forget everything during the presentation?",
        "response": "That’s a common fear. Would you feel more secure using note cards or visuals? Practicing in a safe space could also help your memory lock in."
    },

        "input": "I’ve wasted so much time, I don’t think I can finish now.",
        "response": "It’s never too late to start again. What’s the very next piece you could complete—just one task—to gain some momentum?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I’m ashamed I didn’t start sooner.",
        "response": "That shame is understandable, but it's also heavy to carry. What if we focused on what’s still possible rather than what’s past?"
    },
    {
        "input": "How can I stay focused until I finish this project?",
        "response": "Try setting up short, focused work blocks with breaks in between—like 25 minutes of work, then 5 minutes of movement. Would that rhythm work for you?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I keep comparing my project to others and feel worse.",
        "response": "Comparison steals your peace. What makes your project unique—your idea, your process, or your effort—that’s worth being proud of?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I’m scared they’ll judge me during my presentation.",
        "response": "That fear is normal. Most panels are there to support your learning, not tear you down. Would role-playing a Q&A help build confidence?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I feel like I don’t deserve to rest.",
        "response": "Rest isn’t a reward—it’s a necessity. What would happen if you gave yourself even 15 minutes of guilt-free rest today?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I haven’t eaten properly in days because of stress.",
        "response": "That’s important to notice. Would it help to plan one easy, comforting meal today—something you like and can prepare without stress?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I don’t have time for self-care right now.",
        "response": "Even two minutes of deep breathing or stretching can reset your system. What’s one quick thing you could do for yourself, even during a break?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I can’t remember the last time I felt okay.",
        "response": "That’s a painful realization. Would you be open to checking in with how you’re feeling physically, emotionally, and mentally—just to name it?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I feel like I’m falling apart inside.",
        "response": "That sounds really heavy. You're doing your best under pressure. What would being kind to yourself look like today—without judgment?"
    },
    {
        "input": "How do I rebuild confidence after so much stress?",
        "response": "Confidence grows through small wins. Can you name one thing you’ve done well this week, even if it didn’t feel perfect?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I feel like I’m failing even though I’m trying so hard.",
        "response": "Trying hard *is* something to be proud of. Would it help to list what you’ve already done, not just what’s left?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I haven’t talked to anyone about how I feel.",
        "response": "Opening up takes courage. Is there someone—friend, family, or advisor—you trust enough to just start with, ‘I’m not doing okay right now’?"
    },
    {
        "input": "What if I never feel better?",
        "response": "That’s a scary thought, but you won’t feel this way forever. Would it help to create a tiny list of things that gave you joy in the past—even little ones?"
    },
    {
        "input": "How do I take care of my mental health while finishing my project?",
        "response": "Think of it like fuel—you can’t run on empty. What’s one daily habit you could add, like stretching, music, or journaling, to support your brain?"
    },
    {
        "input": "How do I become more professional in my field?",
        "response": "Professionalism starts with consistency, communication, and self-growth. What area do you want to improve most—skills, confidence, or networking?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I want to be better prepared for life after graduation.",
        "response": "That’s a great mindset. Have you thought about building routines, learning time management, or creating goals for your next year?"
    },
    {
        "input": "How do I manage my time better when I have too much going on?",
        "response": "When life feels overloaded, planning matters more. Do you use a planner, calendar, or to-do list to break things down into daily steps?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I keep setting goals and not reaching them.",
        "response": "That’s frustrating, but common. Are your goals too big all at once—or do you struggle with staying motivated over time?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I want to be more confident in my career path.",
        "response": "Confidence comes from experience and reflection. Have you looked into mentorship, small leadership roles, or real-world projects to practice?"
    },
    {
        "input": "How do I prepare for a job interview?",
        "response": "Great question. Have you practiced answering common questions, researched the company, and prepared stories about your strengths?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I get nervous before doing anything important.",
        "response": "Performance anxiety is totally human. Do you prepare with notes, practice runs, or even mental rehearsals before big events?"
    },
    {
        "input": "How do I become more consistent in my daily routine?",
        "response": "Start small. Have you tried setting one non-negotiable habit—like waking up at the same time or reviewing your tasks each morning?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I want to grow, but I feel lost.",
        "response": "Growth starts with clarity. What’s one area of life—career, mindset, relationships—where you’d love to feel more grounded?"
    },
    {
        "input": "How can I improve my communication skills?",
        "response": "Communication improves with practice. Do you prefer writing, speaking, or listening—and where do you feel you struggle most?"
    },
    {
        "input": "How do I choose the right career path?",
        "response": "Start by exploring what excites you, not just what seems practical. Have you thought about your values, strengths, and the kind of impact you want to make?"

    },
    {
        "input": "How do I set goals that I can actually reach?",
        "response": "Try the SMART method—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. What’s one short-term goal you could start this week?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I don’t know what my goals should even be.",

        "input": "How do I stay motivated when things get hard?",
        "response": "Motivation often fades, but habits keep us going. What small habit could support your goal even on tough days?"
    },
    {
        "input": "How do I bounce back from setbacks?",
        "response": "Resilience is built, not born. Can you think of one time you got through something difficult—and what helped you keep going then?"
    },
    {
        "input": "I keep changing my goals and feel lost.",
        "response": "It’s normal to shift direction. Are you changing because you’re learning what fits you—or because you’re doubting yourself too soon?"
    },

        "input": "How can I build self-discipline?",

        "input": "How do I know I’m making progress when I still feel bad?",
